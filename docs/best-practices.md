# üåü Best Practices Guide

This guide provides practical recommendations for getting the most out of A3X and the SeedAI approach.

## Core Principles

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Gradually

**Begin with basic tasks:**
```bash
# Start here
a3x run --goal "Create a simple calculator" --config configs/sample.yaml

# Then try more complex tasks
a3x run --goal "Build a web API with authentication" --config configs/sample.yaml
```

**Why it works:**
- Learn A3X's capabilities incrementally
- Understand your specific use cases
- Build confidence with proven results
- Identify customization needs early

### 2. Be Specific with Goals

**‚ùå Avoid vague goals:**
- "Make it better"
- "Fix stuff"
- "Add things"

**‚úÖ Use specific goals:**
- "Add input validation to user registration form"
- "Fix the memory leak in data processing function"
- "Create REST API endpoints for user management"

**Benefits:**
- Clearer expectations for A3X
- More predictable results
- Easier to evaluate success
- Better learning from outcomes

### 3. Embrace Iteration

**Work iteratively:**
```bash
# First iteration
a3x run --goal "Create basic user model" --config configs/sample.yaml

# Second iteration
a3x run --goal "Add validation and error handling" --config configs/sample.yaml

# Third iteration
a3x run --goal "Add comprehensive tests" --config configs/sample.yaml
```

**Advantages:**
- Easier to review and correct course
- Builds understanding progressively
- Allows for learning and adaptation
- Reduces risk of major failures

## Goal Writing Best Practices

### 1. Structure Your Goals

**Effective goal structure:**
```
[Action] [Target] [Requirements] [Constraints]
```

**Examples:**
```
"Create user authentication system with JWT tokens and email validation"
"Fix memory leak in data processing pipeline for large datasets"
"Add comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage for calculator module"
```

### 2. Include Success Criteria

**Define what success looks like:**
```bash
# Goal with clear success criteria
a3x run --goal "Create user registration with email validation that accepts valid emails and rejects invalid ones" --config configs/sample.yaml
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Easier debugging if issues arise
- Better understanding of requirements

### 3. Provide Context

**Include relevant context:**
```bash
a3x run --goal "Fix the login bug where users get 'Invalid credentials' error even with correct email/password" --config configs/sample.yaml
```

**Context helps:**
- Understand the specific issue
- Know expected vs. actual behavior
- Identify the right solution approach

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Environment-Specific Configs

**Different configs for different environments:**

```yaml
# Development config (configs/dev.yaml)
llm:
  model: "x-ai/grok-beta"  # Fast, good for development
  temperature: 0.7        # Creative

# Production config (configs/prod.yaml)
llm:
  model: "x-ai/grok-beta"  # Stable, reliable
  temperature: 0.3        # Consistent
```

### 2. Project-Specific Settings

**Customize for your project type:**

```yaml
# Web API projects
execution:
  test_command: "pytest tests/ -v"
  lint_command: "black . && isort ."

# Data science projects
execution:
  test_command: "python -m pytest tests/"
  analysis_command: "jupyter nbconvert --to script *.ipynb"
```

### 3. Safety-First Configuration

**Always prioritize safety:**

```yaml
safety:
  require_tests: true     # Always run tests
  backup_before_changes: true  # Backup before modifications
  allowed_paths:         # Restrict file operations
    - "/opt/projects"
  deny_patterns:         # Block dangerous operations
    - "rm -rf /"
    - "sudo *"
```

## Workflow Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow

**Effective daily workflow:**

```bash
# Morning: Plan and prioritize
a3x run --goal "Review current codebase and suggest improvements" --config configs/sample.yaml

# Afternoon: Implement features
a3x run --goal "Implement user authentication feature" --config configs/sample.yaml

# Evening: Test and validate
a3x run --goal "Run comprehensive tests and validate functionality" --config configs/sample.yaml
```

### 2. Debugging Workflow

**Systematic debugging approach:**

1. **Reproduce the issue:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Reproduce and document the specific bug" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

2. **Analyze root cause:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Analyze code and identify the root cause" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

3. **Implement fix:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Implement the fix with proper error handling" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify and test:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Test the fix and add regression tests" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

### 3. Code Review Workflow

**Review code generated by A3X:**

1. **Examine the code:**
   - Check for obvious errors
   - Verify logic and approach
   - Review security implications

2. **Test thoroughly:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Run comprehensive tests on the generated code" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

3. **Request improvements if needed:**
   ```bash
   a3x run --goal "Improve error handling and add input validation" --config configs/sample.yaml
   ```

## SeedAI Best Practices

### 1. Seed Management

**Effective seed practices:**

```yaml
# Well-structured seed
seed:
  name: "api-security"
  goal: "Add comprehensive security to API endpoints"
  priority: "high"

    - "JWT token validation"
    - "Rate limiting"
    - "Input sanitization"
  success_criteria:
    - "All endpoints protected"
    - "Security tests pass"
    - "No vulnerabilities detected"
```

### 2. Autonomous Operation

**Set up effective autonomous workflows:**
